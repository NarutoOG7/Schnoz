 So say that you choose a new location or simulate being in New York City, when you click on the result (the table cell), how do i tell the SearchViewController-GMSADelegate-placeSelected that it was selected by a specific searchbar?
  
    -Can I create/add to DoubleSearchDelegate with like a currentBar value?
        -Yes, I think I solved that part
 
 OK now, I have the delegate in place and the data when a place is selected. Now I need to implement the logic into the search. Take the area search text and put it into the exploreVM search area.
